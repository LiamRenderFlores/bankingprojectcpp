Reflection on Weeks 6-7:

I implemented inheritance and polymorphism using virtual functions for Accounts including SavingsAccounts and CheckingAccounts which allows the same functions to be used for different Accounts and I created test units in the main function for Account and its derived classes and the output shows it works accordingly.
