Challenges and Solutions

Challenges
1. Making a system to store data for all information.
2. Making information protected by authentication.
3. Making the login comparison search and the account information search efficient.

Solutions
1. For a simple system I can make the program read and write to a text file that holds information and if I needed a complex system I would use a relational database to get rid of reoccuring data and users with multiple accounts.
2. I can make a class that stores information private or protected and make the authenticate class a friend class that can access it to determine access and make a private file for information for each account. 
3. I can make an account number system and an organized file system to search for the account more efficiently which holds all the information of the account or I make a system using a hashmap if I need even faster retrieval of data.
