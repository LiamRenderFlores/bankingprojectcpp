Reflection on Weeks 4-5

Every time I needed to implement a new function for the banking system I needed to think through what I required of the system and program and what would be the best way to implement it and how I can improve readability. 
Also, I had to think of what I needed to implement in the future like storing information and how I can optimize that with the base structure so I don't have to change a lot later and I can save time.
My current projects outline when completed will be able to do the most important tasks for each of the advanced banking functions: transaction history, account management, and user authentication.
For example, it will be able to add and remove balance, create and delete accounts, update information for everything, and it provides an authentication system for security.
